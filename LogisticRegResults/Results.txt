After viewing the results, we checked our data and found that our prediction values are not balanced.
we ran the command - print(y.value_counts()) and got the following:
0 means that there is no possiblity of getting heartdieases in the next 10 years.
1 means that there is.
TenYearCHD
0    3099
1     557

Improvements we plan:
#Consider maybe over-sampling.

1. Loss Function Inverventions
2. Convert the project to run with tensorflow
